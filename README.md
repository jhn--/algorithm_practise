Practise different kinds of sorting, searching and other DSAs.

Selection Sort

Repeat until no unsorted elements remain:
- Search the unsorted part of the data to find the smallest value
- Swap the smallest found value with the first element of the unsorted part

Comments: took me a couple of days a few tries before I was able to identify the the exit conditions and the variables I need.
