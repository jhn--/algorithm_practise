Practise different kinds of sorting, searching and other DSAs.

Selection Sort

Repeat until no unsorted elements remain:
- Search the unsorted part of the data to find the smallest value
- Swap the smallest found value with the first element of the unsorted part

Comments: took me a couple of days a few tries before I was able to identify the the exit conditions and the variables I need.

Bubble Sort

Move the higher valued elements generally towards the right and lower value elements generally towards the left.
 - Set swap counter to a non-zero value
 - Repeat until the swat counter is 0:
  - Reset swap counter to 0
  - Look at each adjacent pair
    - if two adjacent pair are not in order, swap them and add one to the swap counter.

Comment: got it working in an evening.
